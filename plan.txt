Greedy Algorithm idea: Clients with largest alpha/tolerance goes latest, clients with smallest go first
Things at play: Client tolerance, Bandwidth, length of paths, packet for each client

250 algo: in a certain number of streets in a distance how many crosswalks can we reach.
i.e. from the first router/content provider how many clients we can reach in a certain amount of ticks starting with clients at lowest tolerance
(check for every tolerance level of the lists; say you have 10 clients uniquely numbered, for every distance in ticks, which one has max number of clients you can reach)
